# GrottoRoute
Pretty simple mansion grotto auto routing for Polar
Uses a pretty standard shitty mansion route so I would appreciate if someone sends me a better one that I can use to update this lol
Keybinds can be set in the settings

Press keybind
Shift over block of first waypoint (for the current route it's this piece of Cracked Stone Bricks on the far left side)

Shift to confirm or press your set keybind to cancel

It'll be saved to gemstone route 8 so just open polar select a random route then route 8 and itll load

that's it!
I spent 30 minutes on this, so if someone would send me a better route to use for this i'll finish it with customised route selection, other grottos, ect
