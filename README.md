# GrottoRoute
Pretty simple mansion grotto auto routing for Polar.
Uses a pretty standard shitty mansion route so I would appreciate if someone sends me a better one that I can use to update this lol.
Keybinds can be set in the Minecraft control settings.


Using: 

/setroute /setroute <mansion/palace> <1-9>(1-9 for directory)
Press keybind.
Shift over block of first waypoint (for the current route it's this piece of Cracked Stone Bricks on the far left side).

If you want to do palace, the process is the same but you want to set the starting block to here where block 1 is shown in the photo below:

Shift to confirm or press your set keybind to cancel.



that's it!
I spent 30 minutes on this, so if someone would send me a better route to use for this i'll finish it with customised route selection, other grottos, ect.
